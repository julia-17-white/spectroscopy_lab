# Coding Used for the Spectroscopy Lab

## Simulation
```opt_depth_spec.py``` contains the simulation of the optical depth which will be used in the fitting.

## Fabry-Perot Etalon
```scope_1.csv``` is the data obtained from the oscilliscope when running the fabry-perot etalon experiment. These data were taken from the oscope via a usb stick.

```fabry_perot_data.csv``` is the Pythonic analysis of these scope data attempting to find $\Delta t$ so that the changes in frequency could be determined.
